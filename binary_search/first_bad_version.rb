# 278. First Bad Version
# https://leetcode.com/problems/first-bad-version/

# Approach binary search
# start from middle if you find that the mid is bad then you know the answer is to the left of it,
# So we abandon the right half, right of mid to end. This can be achieved by setting r to mid

# If you are setting mid=(left+right)/2, you have to be very careful.
# Unless you are using a language that does not overflow such as Python,
# left + right could overflow. One way to fix this is to use left + (right âˆ’ left)/2 instead.

# Complexity analysis
# Time: O(logn). The search space is halved each time, so the time complexity is O(logn).
# Space: O(1).
