# 278. First Bad Version
# https://leetcode.com/problems/first-bad-version/

# Approach binary search
# 1. Find mid and check if bad
# 2. If bad, you know that everything to right is bad
#    and we want to find the first bad one so search left (r = mid)
# 3. If good, then you know everything before you is good so bad must to the right (l = mid + 1)

# If you are setting mid=(left+right)/2, you have to be very careful.
# Unless you are using a language that does not overflow such as Python,
# left + right could overflow. One way to fix this is to use left + (right âˆ’ left)/2 instead.

# Complexity analysis
# Time: O(logn). The search space is halved each time, so the time complexity is O(logn).
# Space: O(1).
