# 34. Find First and Last Position of Element in Sorted Array
# https://leetcode.com/problems/find-first-and-last-position-of-element-in-sorted-array/

# Complexity Analysis
# Time complexity: O(log(n)
#     Because binary search cuts the search space roughly in half on each iteration,
#     there can be at most ⌈log(n)⌉ iterations.
#     Binary search is invoked twice, so the overall complexity is logarithmic.
# Space complexity : O(1)O(1)

# All work is done in place, so the overall memory usage is constant.
