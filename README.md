### neophyte

- A selection of Algorithms and Data Structures that I've been experimenting with in Ruby along with comprehensive rpsec tests for cases. These are ideal for anyone learning algorithms or preparing for interviews

- Mostly tried to follow the code as per the psuedo code from Introduction to Algorithms - CLRS - 3rd Edition.

- Also has some of my solutions for hacker rank problems that I considered worthy of practice.

- I will tabulate all of the stuff that I've completed and that I'm working on soon.
