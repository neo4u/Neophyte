# 332. Reconstruct Itinerary
# https://leetcode.com/problems/reconstruct-itinerary/description/


# Intuition:
# 1. The problem is to reconstruct the exact order or airports travelled given the tickets
# 2. This is a problem of finding the 'Eulerean Circuit', 
# 3. It's easy to understand as a reverse of a post order traversal
# 4. It's like finding a topological sort, but only this is for a Directed Cyclic Graph as opposed to a DAG,
#    That is the problem of Eulerean Path
# 5. The only thing is if two paths exist from a given airport,
#    then we pick lexical order hence we sort the destinations, from each city
